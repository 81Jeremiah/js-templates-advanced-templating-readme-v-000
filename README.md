JavaScript Handlebars Templates
---

## Objectives

1. Explain how to use Handlebars templates
2. Describe Handlebars' built-in helpers (`if` and `each`)
3. Practice writing a template using Handlebars
4. Write a custom Handlebars helper

## Introduction

- The trick with this lab will be to build on the knowledge that students have gained working with lodash templates without coupling this lesson too tightly to the lessons that happen to come before it in the curriculum

- Shift the focus to working with collections and working with (very limited) logic

## Implementation

- Students can work with the GitHub issues in `issues.js` to render them as collections (maybe based on the number of comments or the date of creation?)

- Students should write their own helper that styles the comment body differently based on whether the issue is open or closed.

## Resources

- [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
